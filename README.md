# Binary to decimal project

First of all, I would like to give the credit for the project idea to [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17).

I've planned to go through every project of [this list](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), so that I can have some sort of guidance about where I have to improve and which new knowledge I can learn.

## How to see it working

You don't need `npm install` unless you want to change the tests and running them. You can call the function and wrap it with a `console.log` to see the result, likewise:`console.log(binaryToDecimal(10101010))`. You also can use the Code Runner Extension in the VSCode or even a debugger.

This project was so simple that I do not feel like I should write a design for it, but for the "custom border css" project I will try it.

## Which problem does this project solve

As the project name can show, with this app you can know every single binary number in the decimal version. But the main problem that this project (and the sucessors of it) solve (and will solve) is my deficit in writing tests. Yes, I know that the tests are not complex and etc. But I'm starting simple. Watch me turning into the best QA in the universe as I go through my career >:D .
